Driving WS2812B rgb leds with a Teensy-LC. 

In the past I learned about driving WS2812Bs with an arduino:

* https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/light_ws2812-library-v2-0-part-i-understanding-the-ws2812/
* My understanding is that the WS2812B leds have a shift register. Data is sent to the DIN pin, bit by bit. Bits are encoded as pulses:
  * 1 bit: high for 0.8us, low for 0.45us
  * 0 bit: high for 0.45us, low for 0.8us
  * Reset: low for &gt;50us  (actually, it's as short as 9us?)
  * Each of the high/low durations can vary by &pm;150ns
  * 1.25us per bit. 24 bits (1 byte for r,g,b) => 30us per led
  * How does it work? (cpldcpu)
    * The shift registers of WS2812Bs can be chained (DOUT to DIN of the next one). And it turns out the WS2812B reshapes the inputted signal into its true (?) format which we can see at DOUT.
    * The period (1.25us) seems to be divided into 6 parts:
      * 1 bit: high for 4/6, low for 2/3
      * 0 bit: high for 2/6, low for 4/6
        * but the pulse length can vary by 150ns, which is less than 1/6.
      * After receiving the rising edge of a pulse, how long does it take for it a pulse to be shifted out? 1/6.
      * I'd like to know how the timing works internally one day... (multivibrator?)
  
* On an arduino, we have to bit-bang the pulses.
* On a raspberry pi, the pulses can be generated by PWM, where data is sent via DMA to the PWM module (I didn't look into this)
